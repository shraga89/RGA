Our main contributions can be summarized as follows. 

\begin{compactitem}
	\item We introduce a buying strategy for players in a data market including a dataset allocation and price prediction (Section~\ref{sec:model}).
	\item We provide a novel data market simulation to be publicly available upon acceptance (Section~\ref{sec:sim}) based on a model defined Section~\ref{sec:datamarket}.
	\item Using the simulation, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept of our approach, showing its superiority over several baseline methodologies (Section~\ref{sec:res}).  
\end{compactitem}

In addition, we discuss related work in Section~\ref{sec:related} and conclude in Section~\ref{sec:con}.
